## What is This?

Sams Product OS is an AI-powered personal operating system to organize my PM workspace

- **Two-Bucket Workflow** - Backlog (with Active section) → Archive keeps you focused
- **Weekly Focus** - Brain dump → Prioritized weekly plan in `tasks/TASKS.md`
- **Document Generation** - Specs, briefs, PRDs from conversation
- **Research Synthesis** - Transform interviews into insights
- **Voice Training** - Match your writing style

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samkawsarani/sams-product-os.git
cd sams-product-os
```

### 2. Prerequisites

- **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)** — required to use this system
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)** — optional, needed for [QMD](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) semantic search. The agent falls back to file search without it.

### 3. Run Setup

```bash
./setup.sh
```

Creates your workspace, sets up knowledge base directories, seeds starter files, and optionally installs QMD and plugins.

### 4. Start Using It

**Brain dump to `tasks/TASKS.md`:**
```markdown
## Product
- Follow up with Sarah about Q4 goals

## Strategy
- Mobile Performance Issues
  - Source: Support tickets (15 this week)
  - Context: Android app slow on startup
```

**Process your backlog:**
```
/process-backlog
```

AI reads your backlog + goals, recommends top 3–5 priorities with one-line rationale, confirms with you, then updates the Active section at the top of `tasks/TASKS.md`:
- **In Progress** — working on now
- **Up Next** — committed this week
- **Waiting On** — blocked on someone else

> **Start here, build as you go.** `GOALS.md` and `tasks/TASKS.md` are the core — fill those in first. Add a few files to `knowledge/` about your role, company, and strategy; the agent gets meaningfully smarter with even basic context, and you can add more over time. Voice training and plugins are optional — add them when you feel the friction of not having them.

## Context Setup

The `knowledge/` folder is your AI's long-term memory. It has two types of content:

### Reference Context (set up by you)

Files you create once and update as things change. The AI reads these to understand who you are, how your team works, and what your strategy is.

| Folder | What to put there |
|--------|-------------------|
| `about-me/` | Role, background, working style, strengths |
| `company-context/` | Mission, products, team, org structure |
| `product-strategy/` | Vision, strategic pillars, roadmap, OKRs |
| `processes/` | How your team works, sprint cadence, decision-making |
| `references/` | Competitive research, articles, open requests |
| `voice-samples/` | Writing samples for style matching (see [Voice Training](#voice-training)) |
| `decisions/` | Decision log — one file per significant decision |
| `opportunities/` | Observed problems and ideas to explore — groomed feature requests, market signals, patterns |
| `people/` | *(Optional)* One file per person — direct reports, stakeholders, key peers. Useful at manager/director/VP level. |

AI reads files in priority order: `about-me/` → `product-strategy/` → `company-context/` → task-relevant folders.

Reference files explicitly with `@knowledge/product-strategy/current-strategy.md`.

### Domain Learning (maintained by your agent)

As you work, your agent builds up learned knowledge in domain-specific folders under `knowledge/domains/` (e.g., `knowledge/domains/payments/`, `knowledge/domains/checkout-flow/`). Each domain folder holds two files: `knowledge.md` (confirmed facts and rules — applied by default) and `hypotheses.md` (patterns under observation, tracked toward confirmation). Cross-domain rules live in `knowledge/domains/shared.md` (gitignored). The agent creates these automatically; you never pre-populate them. See `knowledge/AGENTS.md` for the full knowledge architecture and maintenance rules.

See `knowledge/INDEX.md` for a directory of what's in your knowledge folder.

---

## What Gets Committed vs. Gitignored

**Committed (shared structure):**
- Directory structure, templates, `.claude/skills/`
- `AGENTS.md` and subdirectory `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` files (agent instructions for each folder)

**Gitignored (your data):**
- `GOALS.md`, `VOICE-GUIDE.md`
- Content in `tasks/`, `knowledge/`, `projects/`, `meetings/`, `_temp/`
- Note: `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` inside any folder are always tracked

---

## Core Workflow

```
tasks/TASKS.md (## Active section) → /process-backlog → tasks/_archived/YYYY-MM.md
```

1. **Brain dump** to `tasks/TASKS.md` throughout the day
2. **Process** with `/process-backlog` — AI picks top 3–5 priorities aligned to your goals, updates `## Active` in `tasks/TASKS.md`
3. **Work** — In Progress, Up Next, Waiting On tracked in the `## Active` section
4. **Archive** — Log completed work to `tasks/_archived/YYYY-MM.md` during weekly review

---

## Tasks

### Two-Bucket System

Tasks live in two files.

**`tasks/TASKS.md`** — Active section at top, brain dump below. One file.
```markdown
## Active — Week of Apr 7–11
**Focus:** Ship the pricing experiment

### In Progress
- [ ] Review PRD draft with eng lead

### Up Next
- [ ] Schedule merchant feedback call

### Waiting On
| Who | What | Since | Next step |
|-----|------|-------|-----------|
| Legal | Contract review | Apr 8 | Follow up if no word by Apr 10 |

---

## Product
- Follow up with Sarah about Q4 goals

## Strategy
- Research competitive pricing changes
```

**`tasks/_archived/YYYY-MM.md`** — Monthly retrospective. Logged at week-end.
```markdown
## Week of Apr 7–11

### Shipped
- Pricing experiment launched to 10% of users

### Completed
- PRD draft reviewed and approved
```

### Managing Tasks

**Daily:**
- `/start-my-day` — morning briefing with calendar, focus-time check, inbox/Slack triage, meeting prep, active tasks
- "What am I working on?" — agent reads `## Active` in `tasks/TASKS.md`
- "Show my backlog" — agent reads `tasks/TASKS.md`
- Brain dump into `tasks/TASKS.md`

**Weekly:**
- `/process-backlog` — classify and clean the backlog
- `/weekly-review` — review progress, plan next week, log to archive

---

## Projects

A project is committed discrete work — a clear objective, connected to a goal, with real outputs. One folder per project in `projects/`.

```
projects/
└── checkout-redesign/
    ├── brief.md        # From templates/project-brief-template.md
    ├── research.md
    └── outputs/
```

Each project brief has:
```markdown
# Checkout Redesign

**Goal:** [Which goal from GOALS.md does this serve?]
**Status:** Active | On Hold | Complete
**Started:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Objective
## Target Customer
## Success
## What I Believe
## What I Need to Research
## Solution Directions
## Risks to Validate
## Updates
```

Active projects generate tasks — reference the project folder when adding related items to `tasks/TASKS.md`.

---

## Skills

This is the base project with core skills built in. Install additional skills from the plugin marketplace to extend your capabilities.

### Built-in Skills

**Process Backlog (`/process-backlog`):**
- Reads backlog + goals, recommends top 3–5 priorities for the week
- Confirms with you, then updates the `## Active` section in `tasks/TASKS.md`

**Start My Day (`/start-my-day`):**
- Morning briefing — calendar, focus-time check, inbox/Slack triage, meeting prep, active task priorities
- `/start-my-day week`: week overview with focus-hour totals
- Aliases: `/daily-pulse`, "morning pulse", "what's my day look like"

**End My Day (`/end-my-day`):**
- End-of-day review — rest-of-week focus protection, tomorrow preview, action items from meeting notes, insights
- Aliases: "end my day", "wrap up my day", "what's happening tomorrow"

**Weekly Review (`/weekly-review`):**
- Reflect on past week, plan next week, log to archive
- `/weekly-review quick`: condensed version

**Weekly Update (`/weekly-update`):**
- Draft a stakeholder update email
- Uses Linear projects and initiatives if MCP is connected, falls back to `tasks/TASKS.md`
- Reads `knowledge/people/` for stakeholder preferences

## Voice Training

Give AI examples of your actual writing, then have it extract patterns and apply them.
### Step 1: Collect Your Writing Samples

Gather 5-10 examples of your real writing. Mix of formats works best:

```
knowledge/
├── voice-samples/
│   ├── email-to-colleague.md
│   ├── email-to-exec.md
│   ├── slack-messages.md
│   ├── linkedin-post.md
│   ├── blog-post-excerpt.md
│   └── product-spec-intro.md
```

**What makes good samples:**

- Emails you actually sent (not templates)
- Slack messages that got good responses
- Posts that felt authentically "you"
- Writing you're proud of

**What to avoid:**

- Heavily edited/formal documents
- Writing you copied from somewhere
- Samples that don't represent your natural style

### Step 2: Run Voice Analysis

Ask your agent to analyze your samples:

```
Read all files in knowledge/voice-samples/ and analyze my writing style.
Extract specific patterns for:
1. Sentence structure and length
2. How I open and close messages
3. Words/phrases I use often
4. What I never say
5. Tone and formality level
6. How I structure arguments

Create a voice guide.
```

### Step 3: Review the Voice Guide
Your agent will produce something like:

```md
## Your Writing Voice

### Sentence Style
- Short sentences. Punchy. You rarely go over 15 words.
- Questions used to transition: "So what does this mean?"
- Em dashes avoided - you use commas or periods instead

### Openers
- Emails: Jump straight to the point, no "Hope you're well"
- Posts: Lead with a surprising fact or bold claim
- Specs: Start with the user problem, not the solution

### Signature Phrases
- "Here's the thing..."
- "Let's be real"
- "The short version:"
- Ends with clear next step or question

### What You Avoid
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "Please don't hesitate to reach out"
- Bullet point lists in emails (prefer paragraphs)
- Emojis in professional context
- "Key insights" or "learnings"

### Tone Calibration
- To peers: Casual, direct, occasional humor
- To execs: Concise, data-first, clear ask
- Public posts: Confident but not salesy
```

### Step 4: Save It (Optional)

**Option A: Save to VOICE-GUIDE.md** (faster, more consistent)
```
Save this to VOICE-GUIDE.md in the project root.
```
This file is gitignored. The agent automatically checks for it when drafting content.

**Option B: Skip saving** (simpler, always fresh)
Let the agent read from `knowledge/voice-samples/` each time you ask it to match your voice.

### Step 5: Test and Refine
```
Draft an email to my VP about pushing the launch date back one week.
Match my voice from VOICE-GUIDE.md (or knowledge/voice-samples/).
```

Compare the output to how you'd actually write it. Give feedback:

```
Good start, but I wouldn't say "I wanted to reach out" - I'd just say
"Quick update on launch timing." Also too many bullet points, I usually
write in short paragraphs. Try again.
```

**Maintenance**: Add new samples monthly as your voice evolves.
```
Read my recent writing in [location] and update my voice guide.
What patterns have changed? What's new?
```

## Best Practices

**Daily:**
- Brain dump to `tasks/TASKS.md` throughout the day
- Ask "what am I working on?" to check active tasks

**Weekly:**
- `/process-backlog` to classify and clean
- `/weekly-review` to reflect, plan, and archive
- Update `## Active` in `tasks/TASKS.md` at the start of each week

**Context:**
- Start small — add context as you go
- Update voice samples quarterly

**Tips:**
- Use @ mentions: `@knowledge/product-strategy/`
- Process 3-5 backlog items at a time, not 50
- Keep the Active section focused — if you can't finish it this week, it belongs below in the backlog
- Install additional skills from the plugin marketplace

**Troubleshooting:**
- Generic responses? Add more to `knowledge/`
- AI not using context? Use @ mentions explicitly
- Overwhelmed by backlog? `/process-backlog` to declutter
